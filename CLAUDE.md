- Auth: Bearer token (OVERSEERR_MCP_TOKEN) + Overseerr API key (OVERSEERR_API_KEY)

## Commands

```bash
just dev       # run locally
just test      # run tests
just lint      # ruff check
just build     # docker build
```


## Version Bumping

**Every feature branch push MUST bump the version in ALL version-bearing files.**

Bump type is determined by the commit message prefix:
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → **major** (X+1.0.0)
- `feat` or `feat(...)` → **minor** (X.Y+1.0)
- Everything else (`fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, etc.) → **patch** (X.Y.Z+1)

**Files to update (if they exist in this repo):**
- `Cargo.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[package]`
- `package.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `pyproject.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[project]`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `gemini-extension.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
- `README.md` — version badge or header
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new entry under the bumped version

All files MUST have the same version. Never bump only one file.
CHANGELOG.md must have an entry for every version bump.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
