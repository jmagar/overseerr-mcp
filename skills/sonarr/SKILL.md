# Sonarr TV Show Management Skill

Search and add TV shows to your Sonarr library with support for monitor options, quality profiles, and search-on-add.

## Purpose

This skill enables management of your Sonarr TV show library:
- Search for TV shows by name
- Add shows to your library with configurable options
- Check if shows already exist
- Remove shows (with optional file deletion)
- View quality profiles and root folders

Operations include both read and write actions. **Always confirm before removing shows with file deletion.**

## Setup

Add credentials to `~/.config/overseerr-mcp/.env` (or `~/.config/overseerr-mcp/.env`). Run the `config-media-stack` skill to configure automatically.

```bash
SONARR_URL="http://localhost:8989"
SONARR_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
SONARR_DEFAULT_QUALITY_PROFILE="1"  # Optional: defaults to 1 if not set
```

**Configuration variables:**
- `SONARR_URL`: Your Sonarr server URL (no trailing slash)
- `SONARR_API_KEY`: API key from Sonarr (Settings → General → API Key)
- `SONARR_DEFAULT_QUALITY_PROFILE`: Quality profile ID (optional, defaults to 1)

## Commands

All commands return JSON output.

### Search for Shows

```bash
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr search "Breaking Bad"
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr search "The Office"
```

**Output:** Numbered list with TVDB IDs, titles, years, and TVDB links.

```bash
# Raw JSON (for capturing TVDB IDs programmatically)
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr search-json "Breaking Bad"
```

### Check if Show Exists

```bash
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr exists <tvdbId>
```

**Output:** `"not_found"` if absent; `"exists"` plus a detail line (ID, title, season count) if present.

### Add a Show

```bash
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr add <tvdbId>                            # Searches immediately (default)
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr add <tvdbId> <profileId>                # Use specific quality profile
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr add <tvdbId> --no-search                # Add without searching
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr add <tvdbId> <profileId> --no-search    # Profile + no search
```

**Note:** Always monitors all seasons (`monitor: "all"`). For finer-grained season control, use the Sonarr UI after adding.

### Remove a Show

```bash
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr remove <tvdbId>                # Keep files
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr remove <tvdbId> --delete-files # Delete files too
```

**Important:** Always ask the user if they want to delete files when removing!

### Get Configuration

```bash
bash skills/sonarr/scripts/sonarr config
```

**Output:** Available root folders and quality profiles with their IDs.

## Workflow

When the user asks about TV shows:

1. **"Add Breaking Bad to Sonarr"** → Run `search "Breaking Bad"`, present results with TVDB links, then `add <tvdbId>`
2. **"Is The Office in my library?"** → Run `exists <tvdbId>`
3. **"Remove Game of Thrones"** → Ask about file deletion, then run `remove <tvdbId>` with appropriate flag
4. **"What quality profiles do I have?"** → Run `config`

### Presenting Search Results

Always include TVDB links when presenting search results:
- Format: `[Title (Year)](https://thetvdb.com/dereferrer/series/<tvdbId>)` (use the numeric TVDB ID from search output)
- Show numbered list for user selection
- Include year and brief overview

### Adding Shows

1. Search for the show
2. Present results with TVDB links
3. User picks a number
4. Add show (searches for episodes by default)

## Parameters

### add command
- `<tvdbId>`: TVDB ID of the show (required)
- `[profileId]`: Optional quality profile ID (positional, before `--no-search`); defaults to `SONARR_DEFAULT_QUALITY_PROFILE` or first available
- `--no-search`: Don't search for episodes after adding

### remove command
- `<tvdbId>`: TVDB ID of the show (required)
- `--delete-files`: Also delete media files (default: keep files)

## Notes

- Requires network access to your Sonarr server
- Uses Sonarr API v3
- All data operations return JSON
- Quality profile IDs vary by installation — use `config` to discover yours
- The `SONARR_DEFAULT_QUALITY_PROFILE` from `.env` is used when adding shows (defaults to 1)

## Agent Tool Usage Requirements

When running script commands via the zsh tool, always pass `pty: true` — without it, command output will be suppressed even though the command executes successfully.
